## SOLONG PROJECT
#### ABOUT SOLONG
Solong project represent a first approch with the graphic side of the programming universe.
Working with a graphic library provided by the school (MLX library), I created a simple 2D game that
considers obstacles, enemies and displays the player moves in real time.
To run it properly, you need to download the mlx library (https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux), 
and clone it in a folder named "mlx" in the the same directory of the project.
###### ABOUT 42 FLORENCE
 Solong was the first graphic project I worked on while attending at 42 Florence, an innovating programming school.
 The course is mainly in C, but you get to explore C++, HTML, JavaScript and a little bit of Python, thanks 
 to the workshops and events that the school provides.
